# BiomarkerMine
This project uses GTEx v8 RNA expression data across 54 human tissues to discover tissue-specific biomarkers. It quantifies gene-tissue specificity with Tau scoring, validates known clinical markers (KLK3/PSA, MUC16/CA-125, TNNT2/cardiac troponin), and ranks candidate genes for disease research and precision medicine applications.
